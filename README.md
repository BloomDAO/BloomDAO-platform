# BloomDAO-platform
BloomDAO will allow investors to deposit capital in the form of BloomDAO tokens and supported stable coins. It
enables diversification in cryptocurrency such as the Metaverse, oracles, DeFi and NFTs. BloomDao is built on an
interoperable DeFi protocol that allows cross-chain investments and trades. The platform opens new
opportunities to users and leverages blockchain and off chain technology to deliver high speed, low-cost trading
at the click of a button. As a hybrid protocol, investors are afforded access to assets across all networks. One of
the striking advantages of this cross-chain protocol is the cheap cost to users, allowing users to invest additional
funds that would otherwise be used on transaction fees.
inBLOOM (IBL) are tokenized indices, baskets of assets represented with one easy to-manage token.
inBLOOM is fully backed by the underlying assets, redeemable at any time.
fullBLOOM (FBL) are tokens used in an incentive system (including staking, farming and fee savings). This will
be the next generation of BloomDAO products. It will actively employ each of the underlying assets with a yieldgenerating Automated Market Makers (AMM) strategy while depositing assets for high returns (for example,
staking tokens to earn rewards). AMMs allow digital assets to be traded without permission and automatically
by using liquidity pools. Strategies employed can be i.e. staking and lending. fulllBLOOM bounces between
strategies, maintaining the highest possible yield as rates fluctuate. Governance, staking, lending, and interestbearing assets are enabled by default and operate in the background without requiring any extra work from
BloomDAO holders.
